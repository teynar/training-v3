In the previous lesson we explored building a GraphQL API using the Neo4j GraphQL Library that implemented basic create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functionality. In this lesson we explore adding custom logic to our GraphQL using the power of the Cypher query language.

== Codesandbox Setup

To begin we'll clear out our Neo4j database, open a new Codesandbox, and run a GraphQL mutation to add some initial data.

First, open Neo4j Browser for your Neo4j Sandbox instance and run the following Cypher query to delete all the data in the database

> Make sure you're running this command in the correct database as this will delete all data in the Neo4j database!

[source,Cypher]
----
MATCH (a) DETACH DELETE a
----

Next, open https://codesandbox.io/s/github/johnymontana/training-v3/tree/master/modules/graphql-apis/supplemental/code/03-graphql-apis-custom-logic/begin?file=/.env[this Codesandbox^] and edit the `.env` file, adding the connection credentials for your Neo4j Sandbox. Refer to the set instructions in the previous lesson if necessary.

In GraphQL Playground running in your Codesandbox, paste and execute the following GraphQL mutation to load the initial data we'll be working with:

== Adding Custom Logic With Cypher And Custom Resolvers

=== The `@cypher` GraphQL Schema Directive

==== Computed Scalar Field

* Order total item
* More complex - shippping cost

[source,GraphQL]
----
extend type Order {
  subTotal: Float @cypher(statement:"MATCH (this)-[:CONTAINS]->(b:Book) RETURN sum(b.price)")
}
----

[source,GraphQL]
----
extend type Order {
  shippingCost: Float @cypher(statement:"")
}
----

==== Computed Node Field

* Book recommendation

==== Computed Object Field

* ???

==== Using Procedures

* Using GDS?

==== Custom Mutation

=== Custom Resolvers

[%interactive.answers]
- [x] True
- [ ] False


=== Question 2

[.statement]

[.statement]
Select the correct answer.

[%interactive.answers]
- [x] `mutation {
  createAddresses(
    input: {
      address: "111 E 5th Ave, San Mateo, CA 94401"
      order: { connect: { where: { orderID: "123" } } }
    }
  ) {
    addresses {
      address
    }
  }
}`
- [ ] `mutation {
  createAddresses(
    input: {
      address: "111 E 5th Ave, San Mateo, CA 94401"
      order: {
        create: { books: { connect: { where: { title: "Graph Algorithms" } } } }
      }
    }
  ) {
    addresses {
      address
    }
  }
}`
- [ ] `CREATE (a:Address {address: "111 E 5th Ave, San Mateo, CA 94401"}) MATCH (o:Order {orderID: "123"}) CREATE (a)<-[:SHIPS_TO]-(o)`

[.statement]
Select all correct answers.

[%interactive.answers]
- [x] DateTime
- [x] Point
- [x] String
