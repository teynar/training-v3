== Neo4j Graph Platform

The Neo4j Graph Platform includes components that enable you to develop your graph-enabled application.

image::Neo4jPlatform.png[Neo4jPlatform,width=700,align=center]

It is used by developers, administrators, data analysts, and data scientists to access application data.
Developers create the data in the graph by either importing it into the graph or using the Cypher language to implement the data model. In addition, developers are responsible for integrating the graph with other systems and database management system (DBMS) installations.
Admins manage the processes and files related to the Neo4j installation.
Data scientists and data analysts typically use a combination of Cypher queries, as well as tools, to analyze the data.
End-users typically use applications written by developers to access the graph data.

ifndef::env-slides[]
== Neo4j DBMS

The heart of the Neo4j Graph Platform is the Neo4j DBMS.
The Neo4j DBMS includes processes and resources needed to manage a single Neo4j instance or a set of Neo4j instances that form a cluster.
A Neo4j instance is a single process that runs the Neo4j server code.
A Neo4j instance at a minimum contains two databases, the system database and the default database, neo4j.


image::Neo4jDBMS.png[Neo4jDBMS,width=300,align=center]

The *system* database stores metadata about the databases for the installation as well as security configuration.
The *default* database (named neo4j by default) is the "user" database where you implement your graph data model.

A Neo4j instance at a minimum contains two databases:

The *system* database:

* Stores *metadata* about the databases
** Installation data
** Security configuration

The *default* database:

* Default name is *neo4j*
* The *"user" database*
* Where you implement your graph data model

[.instructor-notes]
--
The heart of the Neo4j Graph Platform is the *Neo4j DBMS*.

* As of Neo4j 4.0
** A *Neo4j instance* - at a minimum - contains two databases.

One is the *system database* -

* which holds *installation* data and *security configuration*

The other one is known as the *default* or *“user” database*.

* By default it’s named *neo4j*.
* This is where all of the graph information (data) is kept.

You can also have other user databases that you add to these two to

* hold additional graph information.

A *Neo4j instance* is a *single process* that -

* runs the Neo4j server code.

The Neo4j DBMS - includes the processes and resources -
which are needed to manage a single Neo4j instance -
or a set of Neo4j instances that form a cluster.

== Neo4j 4.x DBMS

[.statement]
In Neo4j Enterprise Edition 4.x, you may have more than one "user" database.

image::MultipleDatabases.png[MultipleDatabases,width=500,align=center]

[.statement]
Here we have three "user" databases that hold the application data. You specify one of the databases as the default database.

Next, you will learn about some features of Neo4j DBMS that make it different from the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS).
endif::[]

ifdef::env-slides[]
[.half-column]
== Neo4j 4.x DBMS

Neo4j DBMS comes in two editions:

[squuare]
* Community Edition
* Enterprise Edition

Neo4j Enterprise Edition 4.x supports *multiple "user"* databases

[square]
* For example: These three "user" databases hold different types of application data
* One of the databases is designated as the default database


image::MultipleDatabases.png[MultipleDatabases,width=500,align=center]

[.instructor-notes]
--
Here we have three user databases.

* One that contains information we're going to use for sales.
* One that contains information we use mastering marketing questions.
* and One that we use for answering HR questions.

Whenever you execute a query against Neo4j, -

* you’ll specify in Cypher -
* which of these databases that query will use.
--
endif::[]

ifdef::env-slides[]
[.section-break]
endif::[]

== Index-free adjacency

One of the key features that makes Neo4j graph databases different from an RDBMS is that Neo4j implements
*index-free adjacency*.

To better understand the benefit of index-free adjacency, let's look at how a query executes in an RDBMS.
Suppose you have this table in the RDBMS:

image::RelationalTable1.png[RelationalTable1,width=300,align=center]

You execute this SQL query to find the third-degree parents of the group with the ID of 3:

[source,SQL,role=noplay nocopy]
----
SELECT PARENT_ID
FROM GROUPS
WHERE ID = (SELECT PARENT_ID
    FROM GROUPS
    WHERE ID = (SELECT PARENT_ID
        FROM GROUPS
        WHERE ID = 3))
----

The result of this query is 1, but in order to determine this result, the query engine needed to:

. Locate the innermost clause.
. Build the query plan for the subclause.
. Execute the query plan for the subclause.
. Locate the next innermost clause.
. Repeat steps 2-4.

Resulting in:

* 3 planning cycles
* 3 index lookups
* 3 DB reads

=== Neo4j DBMS: Index-free adjacency (IFA)

With index-free adjacency, Neo4j stores nodes and relationships as objects that are linked to each other.
Conceptually, the graph looks as follows:

image::IFA-1-new.png[IFA-1-new,width=400,align=center]

These nodes and relationships are stored as follows:

image::IFA-2-new.png[IFA-2-new,width=400,align=center]

Suppose we had this query in Cypher:

[source,Cypher,role=noplay nocopy]
----
MATCH (n) <-- (:Group) <-- (:Group) <-- (:Group {id: 3})
RETURN n.id
----

Using IFA, the Neo4j query engine starts with the anchor of the query which is the Group node with the id of 3.
Then it uses the links stored in the relationship and node objects to traverse the graph pattern.

image::IFA-3-new.png[IFA-3-new,width=400,align=center]


To perform this query, the Neo4j query engine needed to:

* Plan the query based upon the anchor specified.
* Use an index to retrieve the anchor node.
* Follow pointers to retrieve the desired result node.

Using IFA, there are:

* Much fewer index lookups or table scans
* Reduced duplication of foreign keys


=== Neo4j DBMS: Graph engine

image::Neo4jDatabase.png[Neo4jDatabase,width=300,align=center]

The heart of the Neo4j Graph Platform is the Neo4j Database.

The Neo4j graph engine interprets Cypher statements to:

[square]
* Execute kernel-level code for optimal performance.
* Optimize data access on disk and cached in memory.

ifndef::env-slides[]
The graph engine has been improved with every release of Neo4j to provide the most efficient access to an application's graph data. There are many ways that you can tune the performance of the engine to suit your particular application needs.
endif::[]

ifdef::env-slides[]
[.instructor-notes]
--
The first, and arguably the most important piece, of the Neo4j platform is the the Neo4j database.

* The database of course is where the graph data is going to be stored.

Neo4j continually focuses on improving the graph engine -

* in order to provide the most efficient and fastest access to graph application data
--
endif::[]

=== Neo4j DBMS: ACID transactions

ifdef::env-slides[]
Transactional consistency - all updates either succeed or fail.
endif::[]

image::ACID.png[ACID,width=800,align=center]

[square]
* Atomicity
* Consistency
* Isolation
* Durability

ifndef::env-slides[]
Transactionality is very important for robust applications that require an ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) guarantee for their data.
If a relationship between nodes is created, not only is the relationship created, but the nodes are updated as connected. 
These updates to the database must [.underline]#all# succeed, otherwise the entire transacton fails and the updates are rolled back.
endif::[]

ifdef::env-slides[]
[.instructor-notes]
--
The Neo4j database also supports full acid compliance.

* This means that - *transactions* are *atomic*, *consistent*, *isolated*, and *durable*.
* *ACID guarantees* a *consistent state* -
** assuring that the database has *transactional consistency*.

*ACID compliance* sounds like something -

* that every single data management paradigm would offer.
* But, if you dive into it, it turns out that, - that isn't true.

Most data management paradigms do not offer not full acid compliance.

* Instead they offer *eventual consistency*.
* The idea is that if you have multiple copies of the data,
** all of them will eventually agree.
*Although you might have *midpoints* for a short amounts of time where they differ.
* Neo4j does not do this.
** Neo4j guarantees consistency across all copies of it at all times.

This is important since - true *ACID compliance* is *rare* - in the *No-SQL* data management world.

* What you are likely to encounter there - is *eventual consistency*, - which is usually good enough.
* But – *eventual consistency* - leaves you open to problems -
** in cases where communication is lost -
** for whatever reason ( between different nodes in the cluster).
--
endif::[]

[.half-column]
=== Neo4j DBMS: Clusters

image::Clustering.png[Clustering,width=600,align=center]

ifndef::env-slides[]
Neo4j supports clusters that provide high availability, scalability for read access to the data, and failover which is important to many enterprises.
Neo4j clusters also maintain ACID transactions across all locations.
Neo4j clusters are only available with Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
endif::[]

ifdef::env-slides[]
Neo4j clusters support:

[square]
* *ACID* across all locations
* Available in *Neo4j Enterprise Edition*

Cluster provide:

[square]
* *High availability*
* *Scalability*
** For read access to data
* *Failover*
** A vital requirement for many enterprises

[.instructor-notes]
--
A Neo4j database can also be clustered.

* You can have many different copies of it, -
** in different physical locations -
** all working together to offer
*** high availability and fault tolerance

The Neo4j database gives *ACID compliant transactions*.

* This is true even in *fully clustered systems* where there are -
** *multiple copies* of the data -
** and *multiple instances* of Neo4j -
** all working together as part of the same solution.

You can find out more about this is in the *Neo4j Operations Manual*.

== Neo4j Aura

image::Aura.png[Aura,width=700,align=center]

Neo4j Aura is the simplest way to run the Neo4j DBMS in the cloud.

[square]
* The Neo4j team manages the administration of Neo4j.
* Developers focus on creating Neo4j applications.

ifndef::env-slides[]
Completely automated and fully-managed, Neo4j Aura delivers the world’s most flexible, reliable and developer-friendly graph database as a service.
With Neo4j Aura, you leave the day-to-day management of your database to the same engineers who built Neo4j, freeing you to focus on building rich graph-powered applications.
Backups are done automatically for you and the database is available 24x7.
In addition,  the Neo4j Aura team will ensure that the database instance is always up-to-date with the latest version of Neo4j.
To use Neo4j Aura, you must pay a monthly subscription fee which is based upon the size of your graph.

Once you create a Neo4j Database at the https://neo4j.com/aura/[Neo4j Aura site], it will be managed by Neo4j.

There are 3 environments where you can develop and work on Neo4j applications.

Let’s start with Aura.

*Neo4j Aura* is a flexible, reliable and developer-friendly *graph database as a service*.

An *advantage* of using Aura is that *day-to-day management* of the Neo4j environment, -

* including the databases, - is done by Neo4j.
* This *frees up developer time* to focus on building graph-powered applications.

Some of the highlights provided by Aura include that:

* The *database* is available *24x7*.
* *Backups* are done *automatically*.
* Aura is *automatically* and *transparently kept up-to-date* with the latest Neo4j version.

Usage of Neo4j Aura is based on a monthly subscription fee.

[.half-column]
== Neo4j Sandbox

ifndef::env-slides[]
The Neo4j Sandbox is a way that you can begin development with Neo4j.
It is a free, temporary, and cloud-based instance of a Neo4j Server with its associated graph that you can access from any Web browser. The database in a Sandbox may be empty or it may be pre-populated. It is started automatically for you when you create the Sandbox.
endif::[]

image::BlankSandbox.png[BlankSandbox,width=600,align=center]

ifndef::env-slides[]
By default, the Neo4j Sandbox is available for three days, but you can extend it for up to 10 days.
If you do not want to install Neo4j Desktop on your system, consider creating a Neo4j Sandbox. You must make sure that you extend your lease of the Sandbox, otherwise you will lose your graph and any saved Cypher scripts you have created in the Sandbox. However, you can use Neo4j Browser Sync to save Cypher scripts from your Sandbox.
We recommend you use the Neo4j Desktop or Neo4j Aura for a real development project.
The Sandbox is intended as a temporary environment or for learning about the features of Neo4j as well as specific graph use-cases.

You create a Sandbox by creating an account at the https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?ref=graph-academy[Neo4j Sandbox site].
endif::[]

ifdef::backend-html5,backend-pdf[]

Another way to develop Neo4j is using the Neo4j Sandbox.

* It is much more limited that Aura.

Neo4j Sandbox is a temporary environment or for learning about the features of Neo4j -

* as well looking looking at specific some graph use-cases that are available.

If you are unable to install Neo4j Desktop on your system, -

* for example do to security issues, this is a good alternative.
* Using Sandbox eliminates the need to install Neo4j on your machine/

Sandbox is a temporary environment that’s typically used for a short evaluation or for training.

* The environment is deleted automatically after 3 days, but can be extended for upto 10 days.
** All of your work is lost when the environment is deleted.

For an actual development project either use *Neo4j Desktop* or  *Neo4j Aura*.

*Additional information:*

* Choose whether the database is *blank* or one of  the *pre-populated* DBs
* Sandbox starts automatically when selecting a graph.
* The associated graph is accessed from a Web browser
* It will may not work if there is an *ad blocker* , VPN, or something else on your system
* You *must accept* tracking *cookies* to use Sandbox.
* You can save Cypher scripts for use in other sandboxes or Neo4j projects.

== Neo4j graph applications

ifndef::env-slides[]
Graph applications provide specific functionality to users that make their roles as developers, administrators, data scientists, or data analysts easier.
Some of them are Web browser-based and some run in their own JVM.
Graph applications are written by Neo4j engineers or Neo4j community members.
Many of the graph applications supported by Neo4j are the work of https://neo4j.com/labs/[Neo4j Labs].
Some graph applications are supported by Neo4j and some are not, so you must be aware of the type of support you can receive for a particular graph application.
You typically install graph applications from your Neo4j Desktop environment from https://install.graphapp.io.

Here are some Neo4j graph applications:

* Each one provides specific functionality that makes performing tasks easier.
* Some of them are *Web browser-based*, -
** while some run in their own *JVM*.

*Graph Apps* are written by *Neo4j engineers* or by *Neo4j community members*.

* Some graph applications are supported by Neo4j
** and some are not.
* For the Graph Apps that you’re planning to use -
** it’s recommended that you take time to find out how it is support.
* Many of the graph applications which are supported by Neo4j -

ifdef::env-slides[]
[.instructor-notes]

Listed here are a few of the graph applications.

We will not be spending time on these in this course,

* with the exception of *Neo4j Browser*.

*Neo4j Browser* is a UI for testing Cypher and graph visualization.

* I’ll be providing information on Neo4j Browser as we go through the course.

*Neo4j Bloom* - is similar to Browser, in that it also has a UI for exploring graphs.

* However, you don’t need to know any Cypher to use it.
* It allows you to explore a graph with just keywords and clicking.

The *Neo4j ETL tool* is used for connecting Neo4j data sources and importing data into a graph.

* This method of import is used somewhat less than others, -
** since there are certain 3rd party graph apps that are also available that work with Cypher.
* They have a cost, but are more powerful.

*Halin* (hay-lin) is a *Neo4j monitoring tool*.

There is a  *Query Log Analyzer tool*.

There’s the *Neo4j Cloud Tool* - which is specific for *Aura*.

The *Graph Data Science Playground* is designed to help you do data science -

* and to work with graph algorithms against the Neo4j database.

These are just the ones that we supply and support as part of our ecosystem.

* You can also attach a number of other third party tools to Neo4j.

[.guided-exercise]
== Guided Exercise: Getting Started with Neo4j Desktop

Note: You must either install Neo4j Desktop, create a Neo4j Sandbox,
or create a Database in Neo4j Aura to perform the hands-on exercises.

[.instructor-notes]
--
*< DEMO Neo4j Desktop>*

A Guided Exercise means that you do the steps -

* and the students follow along and perform the same steps on their laptops.
Some students may choose to use a Neo4j Sandbox.

* They need not follow along on their laptops since they will not be installing the Desktop.

(Video on steps shown to the class: https://youtu.be/uR9-NLxLzg4)

Steps to show:

. In this video, you will learn some of the basic features of Neo4j Desktop 1.4.1.
. When you open Neo4j Desktop for the first time, this is what you will see. It comes with a Neo4j Primer Project and you can see that the Active DBMS is the Movie Database.
. The Movie Database is a pre-populated graph containing people and movies and is a good data model for learning how to write Cypher code.
. The browser guide for this project steps you through some basic Cypher code for accessing the graph. You access the browser guide using Neo4j Browser which is a graph app for accessing a started DBMS.
. There are many ways to open Neo4j Browser. By using the Open Button for a started DBMS or by opening a browser guide for a project.
. Here is a brief look at Neo4j Browser. When in a browser guide, you can step through the pages of the guide.
. When you click on a Cypher code block, it brings the code to the query edit pane where you can execute the code by clicking the Play button.
. Neo4j Browser has many features that enable you to explore the databases in your DBMS. Results returned in Neo4j Browser help you to validate and understand the data in the graph. However, in this video, we will focus on Neo4j Desktop.
. With Neo4j Desktop you can create multiple projects  that are shown in the sidebar here.
. A project in Neo4j Desktop is a representation of a development folder on disk. Within each project, you can create local DBMSs, add connections to remote DBMSs, and add files.
. Some important things to know about Neo4j Desktop are that you can create a local DBMS which is an Enterprise DBMS. It can only be accessed by processes running on your local system. You can have only one DBMS running at a time or one connection to a remote DBMS.
. Let's create a new project. We select New in the Project sidebar. The default name for a project is Project. We want a custom name for our project so we select the edit button and change the name of the project.
. In a project, you can add one or more local DBMSs, connections to remote DBMSs, and files. Let's create a local DBMS.
. When you create a local DBMS, you can change the name of the DBMS to describe your use case.
. You must specify a password that you will remember as it may be required for clients connecting to the DBMS. Neo4j Browser started from Neo4j Desktop automatically uses this password, but other clients may need the user name of neo4j and the password you specify here to connect.
. Next, you can specify the version of the DBMS you want to use. Here we see that the default version that comes with this version of Neo4j Desktop is 4.2.1.
. Notice that you have many versions of the DBMS to choose from, but each one shown here will require that resources need to be downloaded in order to create these versions.
. Then you click Create to create the DBMS for the project.
. If you click the area to the right of the DBMS name, the details for the DBMS are shown, including information about the database and if it is started, the ports it uses.
. The Plugins tab shows the libraries or plugins that you can install for the DBMS. What plugins are available to this DBMS will depend on the version of the DBMS.
. And the Upgrade tab shows information about upgrading the DBMS.
. Let's add another DBMS to our project.
. We name it something different and make sure we provide the password.
. Let's add the APOC library to this DBMS. Adding this plugin enables us to use a large number of useful procedures and functions in our Cypher code. Most Neo4j developers use the APOC library.
. We want to start one of the DBMSs that we just created, but we already have an active DBMS. We must first stop the active DBMS.
. Now let's start one of our DBMSs.
. Once started, we can access it with some of the clients that come with Neo4j Desktop.
. Let's look at some of the ways you can work with the DBMS. The three dots to the right of the Open button show some of the ways you can manage a DBMS, whether it is started or not. We click the dots to the right of the Open button. Here we select settings. The settings are the configuration properties for the DBMS. This file is called neo4j.conf.
. You can also examine the log file for the DBMS. This is helpful for troubleshooting problems.
. Each DBMS has its own set of folders that you can open. The import folder is often used to place CSV filled you import into the graph.
. You can open a terminal window in the folder for the DBMS where you can access tools, cypher-shell, and other files for the DBMS.
. Let's look at what you can do in the sidebar.
. In the Projects sidebar, you can switch between projects. Note, however that the active DBMS is always shown at the top, no matter what project you are working on.
. The Databases area shows the names, locations, and version of the DBMSs.
. The Graph Apps area shows all apps currently installed. You can open any of them for the active DBMS. You can also open the Graph Apps Gallery to explore and install other useful GraphApps.
. The Notifications area shows important information about your installation and update status.
. In the Settings area, you can select or deselect options and you can configure a Proxy if needed for your environment.

Now let’s talk about the Neo4j Browser.
The Neo4j Browser is where we’ll be spending most of our time in this course.

You can run Neo4j Browser either locally or -

* from the cloud through a web browser interface.

To access it locally you must have a local install of Neo4j Desktop.

* The image shown here shows how to start the Browser from the Desktop.

Accessing Neo4j Desktop from the cloud can be done in one of 3 ways.

* From Aura, from sandbox, or from the Desktop.

Neo4j Browser is a Neo4j-supported tool that enables you to access a Neo4j database by executing Cypher statements to create or update data in the graph and to query the graph to return data.
The data returned is typically visualized as nodes and relationships in a graph, but can also be displayed as tables.
In addition to executing Cypher statements, you can execute a number of system calls that are related to the database being accessed by the Browser.
For example, you can retrieve the list of queries that are currently running on the server.

== Guided Exercise: Getting Started with Neo4j Browser

ifdef::env-slides[]

Note: Before you perform the tasks shown in this video, you must have either created and started the database in the Neo4j Desktop, created a Database in Neo4j Aura, or created a Neo4j Sandbox.

In this exercise you will populate the database that will be used for the hands-on exercises.

[.instructor-notes]
--
*< DEMO Neo4j Browser>*

A Guided Exercise means that you do the steps -

* and the students follow along and perform the same steps on their laptops.

This is a LONG Guided Exercise.

* It is important since it introduces students to using the Neo4j Browser effectively.
* During this Guided Exercise, students populate the database which is required prior to any hands-on exercises.

( Video  https://youtu.be/rQTximyaETA)

Here are the script of the video:

. In this Guided Exercise, I am going to show you how to use Neo4j Browser in your development environment.
. If you are using the Neo4j Desktop, you can start the Neo4j Browser application from the project, provided the database for that project has been started.
. You simply click on the Neo4j Browser icon here in the applications area to start it.
. Recall that when you start the Neo4j database, it provides you with information about the ports for accessing the database. The HTTP port on a local server is used for accessing the Neo4j Database from a Web Browser.
. In our Web browser, we simply specify localhost with the port, 7474 to access the database.
. Notice that the UI for the Neo4j Browser application and the UI for the Web browser interface if pretty much identical. The only difference is the cloud area here which you will learn about later in this video.
. You can also access the database running in a Sandbox by navigating to the Sandbox and clicking the link for the browser.
. For this video, I will use the Web browser interface to the Database that is running locally.
. In Neo4j Browser, you have various settings and information on the left that we will learn about later in this video after you have seen how to execute some commands and Cypher statements in the Browser.
. Notice that here, when we access the database for the first time, the command :play start is executed. A command begins with a colon. A Cypher statement does not.
. We type the command :help commands and press the enter or return key. This executes the command and displays the result in the newly created result pane.
. If we type :help keys, information is displayed in the result pane about keyboard shortcuts.
. You can see quick help on Cypher keywords. A very common Cypher keyword you will use is the MATCH keyword for retrieving data from the graph. If we type :help MATCH, we see a brief description of the syntax for using this Cypher keyword.
. The most recent result is always displayed under the edit pane.
. The exception to this is if you pin the pane. If a pane is pinned, it will always stay at its position.
. Let’s pin the pane with the result of executing :help MATCH.
. Here we type a different command, :sysinfo. Notice that the result of executing this command is placed after the pinned pane.
. Let’s unpin this pane and now execute the last command, :sysinfo again. You can use the ctrl/cmd+up/down arrows to select from the command and statement history. Here I am recalling the previously executed command. I can press the enter or return key, or I can select the run icon here to run that command.
. The :history command will display all of the commands and statements that were entered and executed.
. Rather than navigating up/down to find the command or statement you want to execute, you can simply click on a block shown in the history result.
. When you do so, it brings the command or statement into the edit pane so you can optionally modify it and then execute the command or statement.
. Here we recall the :help commands command and modify it in the edit pane to be :help server.
. You can expand and collapse result panes.
. You can also delete result panes if they are not useful to you.
. A setting in the Browser that may be useful for you is the number of result panes to display and the size of the command/statement history.
. You can adjust these here in settings where you can modify the maximum number of result frames and the maximum command or statement history to keep.
. You click the settings icon to collapse that part of the display.
. If you have many result panes displayed and you don’t want to manually delete them, you can use the :clear command to delete all of them.
. Even though you have cleared all of the result panes, you still have access to your command or statement history.
. Up to now, we have seen the execution of commands. Now let’s execute a Cypher statement to show you how the Neo4j Browser executes against the database.
. When we first opened the Neo4j Browser, the first command to execute was the :play start command.
. The :play command is used to execute a browser guide that can be used to step you through some content that may help you learn about Neo4j.
. The :play movie graph command enables you to learn some things about Cypher using the movie database. For this demonstration, I will play the movies browser guide.
. In a browser guide such as this, you can step through the pages of the guide.
. Here on page 2 is what we are interested in. You have not learned Cypher yet, but this large code block can be used to populate the movie database. In many of the guides, if you simply click on the code block, the Cypher statements are then placed in the edit pane.
. You need not understand this long block of Cypher code. We simply run this Cypher statement to load the movie database.
. The Cypher statement executes and displays a graph containing some of the Person and Movie nodes that are connected by relationships.
. When a Cypher statement returns a graph, it can be exported as an image or a CSV file.
. This result is displaying 17 nodes, 9 Person nodes and 8 Movie nodes, along with their corresponding relationships. This is just a subset of the data in the database.
. We can see information about the database by clicking the database icon here.
. The database contains a total of 171 nodes of type Movie and Person. It also contains 253 relationships between the nodes with these types.
. If you click one of these node labels, it automatically returns a sample of at most 25 nodes of the node type from the graph.
. If you click a relationship, it returns a subset of nodes associated with that relationship.
. In addition, the property keys specified here are the properties for the nodes and relationships.
. The Nodes of a graph are displayed with a color coding. Here we see that all Person nodes will be displayed in blue and all Movie nodes will be displayed in green.
. If you click on a type of Node, you can modify the color of the node, the size of the node and which property will be displayed as a caption in the visualization of the graph.
. If you click on a relationship type, you can modify the color and size of the connection.
. In this graph mode, you can also select nodes and rearrange them in this result pane.
. If you want to focus on a particular node, you can select it and do things like expand all of its relationships in an out of the node.
. Or you can remove the node from the display. These actions do not modify the database, simply the display.
. Another way that you can view the results is as a table where a for actors, m for movies, and d for directors has been returned by the Cypher statement.
. Another form of the result is as plain text.
. And of course you can always view the code that was executed.
. Some Cypher statements when executed will return values that are not a graph.
. Here I type the simple Cypher statement MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name LIMIT 5. The result is not a graph, but simply a table or plain text of the five names of Person nodes in the database.
. We can rerun the last statement, modifying it to return 10 names.
. If you execute a statement or command that has a syntax error, the Browser will display the error in the result pane.
. You can delete the last result pane once you have identified the error, recall the last command, correct it, and execute it.
. Now when your browser session ends, all of the commands and statements that you executed are cached in the Web browser’s local store. How the local store for your browser is managed is up to you,  but you cannot rely on the cache being available for your use, especially if you switch browsers or systems.
. As you are executing Browser commands and Cypher statements, you can save them to your favorites.
. If you click the favorites icon on the left, the Favorites pane is visible. This pane contains some starter Cypher code that you can adapt for your needs. In your development environment, you will most likely want to create and maintain a set of Cypher scripts that you can reuse.
. For example, you may want to save the Cypher script for creating the movie database. In our training development environment, we will use the movie database.
. First, we create a folder called Movies in Favorites. This will enable us to place all scripts related to the Movies database in this folder. If we decide to create scripts for a different database, for example, Customers, we would create a folder for those scripts.
. Now we have the huge Cypher script that we previously ran to create the database in our history so we recall it and place it in our edit pane.
. If we were to execute this script again, it would create duplicates of the existing data in the movies database. To prevent this from happening, we place the following statement at the beginning of the script: MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;. You must place the semicolon after this statement because we want to execute two Cypher statements, one to delete all nodes in the database and the next statement to create the data in the database. Note that if you are using the Neo4j Browser application, you must specify that you will allow the multi-statement query editor in settings.
. We execute these statements which will delete all data in the the database and recreate the data.
. If we look at the database, we see that we have the correct number of nodes and relationships.
. Now we want to prepare this script as a favorite. At the beginning of the script in the edit pane, you add a comment which will be interpreted as the name of the script, Here we add the comment //Reset database
. Next we click the favorite icon to add it to the favorites.
. Here we see it in favorites.
. We simply drag the script so that it is placed under the Movies folder.
. We are not done with saving our favorites. The Neo4j Browser when run from a Web browser has access to Browser Sync in the cloud. This enables you to save settings and scripts in the cloud that that you can reuse them in different browsers and systems.
. To perform the Browser Sync, you must sign in to the cloud using an existing account or by creating a new account.
. Once we are connected, any additions to scripts or changes in Neo4j Browser settings will be saved or synced in the cloud. If you remove a script from favorites, it’s removal will be applied in the cloud when you sign out of Browser Sync.
. Here we see the Clear local data button. This is useful sometimes when you need to clear the favorites/settings data in your Web browser cache.
. If you open a Web browser that does not have any cached data for accessing Neo4j, you can simply connect to the cloud to load your scripts and settings into your current browser session. This Neo4j Browser Sync is only available to the Web interface and is not available in the Neo4j Browser application that runs as part of the Neo4j Desktop. For this reason, a best practice is to use the Web interface for the Neo4j Browser as it gives you the most flexibility. In future releases of Neo4j, the Neo4j Browser application will include more functionality to manage resources.
. So that’s a quick tour of using the Neo4j Browser in your development environment. If you want to read more about some tips and tricks when using the Neo4j Browser, visit the Neo4j User Interface Guide in neo4j.com/developer.

== Libraries

ifndef::env-slides[]
Just as there are graph applications written by Neo4j engineers and Neo4j community members, there are libraries you can incorporate into your application.
A library is also called a plugin as it is used to extend what you can do in Cypher.
Some libraries are available in Neo4j Desktop, while you must download and install other libraries.

Functions and procedures from the  Neo4j 3.5 Graph Algorithms Library are officially supported by Neo4j as the Graph Data Science Library (GDS) in Neo4j 4.x.

One of the most popular libraries that is used by most developers is Awesome Procedures of Cypher (APOC).
This library has close to 500 procedures and functions that extend Cypher in ways that make your programming in Cypher much easier for complex tasks.
Since APOC is so widely-used by developers, it comes already-installed in a Neo4j Sandbox and Neo4j Aura.

Another library that also comes with Neo4j Desktop is GraphQL.
GraphQL is an open-source query language for querying parts of a graph. It is not as flexible or powerful as Cypher, but it is used by some applications.

A very popular library for graph visualization is neoviz.js, another project of Neo4j Labs.


Here are the plugins that come with Neo4j Desktop:

== Drivers and language support

ifndef::env-slides[]
Here are some drivers that Neo4j supports:
endif::[]

image::Drivers.png[Drivers,width=600,align=center]

ifndef::env-slides[]
Because Neo4j is open source, you can delve into the details of how the Neo4j Database is accessed, but most developers simply use Neo4j without needing a deeper understanding of the underlying code.
Neo4j provides a full stack that implements all levels of access to the database and clustering layer where you can use our published APIs.
The language used for querying the Neo4j database is Cypher, an open source language.

In addition, Neo4j supports Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, and Go drivers out-of-the box that use Neo4j's bolt protocol for binary access to the database layer.
Bolt is an efficient binary protocol that compresses data sent over the wire as well as encrypts the data.
For example, you can write a Java application that uses the Bolt driver to access the Neo4j database, and the application may use other packages that allow data integration between Neo4j and other data stores or use a common framework such as spring.
You download drivers from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/#drivers[Neo4j driver download page].

It is also possible for you to develop your own server-side extensions in Java that access the data in the database directly without using Cypher.
The Neo4j community has developed drivers for a number of languages including Ruby, PHP, and R.

You can also extend the functionality of Neo4j by creating user-defined functions and procedures that are callable from Cypher.
endif::[]

ifdef::env-slides[]
[.instructor-notes]
--
You also can interact with the graph engine - using a number of other programming languages.

* There are 5 that Neo4j supports as part of the core product.
* These are Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, and Go.

Also, since Neo4j is an open source technology -

* there are other drivers that are available in our community, -
** some of these have been vetted by Neo4j.

If you have an application that speaks a certain language, -

* rather than having to convert everything into Cypher, -
* you can instead use that programming language, -
** by using the appropriate driver as your interface.

You  can find these drivers by going to the site listed here -
